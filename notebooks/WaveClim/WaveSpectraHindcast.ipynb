    "describe the sea surface as a stochastic process and to characterise all possible\n",
    "observations (time records) that could have been made under the conditions of\n",
    "the actual observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "An observation is thus formally treated as one realisation of a stochastic process. Here, we base this treatment on the random-phase/amplitude model (Holthuijsen, 2007), which leads to the wave spectrum, which is the most important form in which ocean waves are described. The basic concept of the wave spectrum is simple, but its many aspects make it seem rather complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "To distinguish the essence from these additional aspects, consider first a wave record, the surface elevation $\\eta(t)$ at one location as a function of time, with duration $D$, obtained at sea with a wave buoy or a wave pole (see Figure below).\n",

    "a Fourier analysis, we can determine the values of the _amplitude_ and _phase_ for\n",
    "each frequency and this would give us the amplitude and phase spectrum for this\n",

    "the previous equation, we exactly reproduce the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most wave records, the phases turn out to have any value between $0$ and $2\\pi$\n",

    "The standard way to calculate the spectrum has been presented, as once the free surface elevation is obtained, this variance density spectrum can be easily obtained, but in this work, the spectrum calculation has been performed in coast, where partitioned sea state variables (partitions will be explained below) and not free surface elevations exist. In this way, this spectrum reconstruction is performed using the variables propagated $H_S$, $T_P$, $T_m$ and $\\theta_m$, where $S(f, \\theta) = S(f) \\cdot D(\\theta)$, being $S(f)$ the spectral energy associated to the frequency and $D(\\theta)$ the spectral energy associated to the direction, is the total wave energy of the spectrum. These two energy variables grouped represent the total spectral energy associated to each frequency and direction in a sea state and are calculated using the equations below, which are also very well explained in (Kumar et al., 2017). First, the frequency distributed spectrum is calculated for each frequency as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S(f) = \\alpha \\cdot H_S^2 \\cdot T_P^{-4} \\cdot f^{-5} \\cdot \\exp{(-1.25 (T_P \\cdot f)^{-4})} \\cdot \\gamma^{\\exp{\\frac{-(T_P \\cdot f - 1)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ gives an idea about the shape of the spectrum, being high for very disordered spectrums and lower for narrower and more powerful swells, and $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$ are calculated in the next way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha = \\frac{0.06238}{0.23 + 0.0336 \\cdot \\gamma - 0.185 \\: (1.9 + \\gamma)^{-1}}\\:\\:(1.094 âˆ’ 0.01915 \\cdot \\ln{\\gamma})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = 0.07 \\:\\:\\: \\text{if} \\:\\:\\: f<f_{P} \\:\\:\\: | \\:\\:\\: \\sigma = 0.09 \\:\\:\\: \\text{if} \\:\\:\\: f\\geq f_{P}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "being $f_P = T_P^{-1}$ the peak frequency of the spectrum. For the directional spectrum, the spectral energy is also calculated for each direction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D(\\theta) = \\frac{2^{2s-1}}{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma^2(s+1)}{\\Gamma(2s+1)}\\cos{\\frac{\\theta - \\theta_S}{2}}^{2s}\n",

Once these spectra are reconstructed we just have to calculate the aggregated parameters (as our surfing index will use bulk parameters), which can be done using some formulas that are explained in (Espejo Hermosa, 2011) and also in (Kumar et al., 2017), but in this case we will use a computational software called [wavespectra](https://github.com/wavespectra/wavespectra).

The axis are frequency [Hz], direction [rad] and energy [m$^2$ / (Hz $\\cdot$ rad)] in the figures in the left and space [m] and elevation [m] in the other ones. As it can be seen, the different subplots show three different sea states. The first one (top of the image) represents a windsea, very spread in frequencies and directions that come from the NE, which is the normal case in the cantabric sea. The free surface associated to it shows a disturbed see state where mean waves appear, generating bad surfing conditions. Second, a very well defined swell coming from the NW is shown. In this case, waves seem clean and the conditions are perfect though. Lastly, in the bottom image, one sea state with a swell coming from the NW but also a windsea approching with NE direction is shown. These are the cases where intelligent surfers can catch good waves, but it is not that easy as in the previous case. Notice that the majority of the swells come always from the W-NW in the cantabric sea, as it is in this direction where the major portion of sea is encountered (\"fetch\", this was previously mentioned). Finally, the surface reconstruction shows very different surfing sessions. In the left, a disperse and untidy summer day is shown and in the right, an ordered and epic session is waiting for us."

    "Last, having this spectrum explanation (refer to the figures above) it is possible to differentiate between the two main types of waves that could be encountered when approaching the beach. If the spectrum is narrow and energetic, high wave heights form energetic spectrums, thus the train of waves reaching the shore can be considered a swell while broader and less energetic spectrums represent the existence of sea states called windseas, as these waves did not have the time enough to correctly abandon the location where they were formed and did not have time enough to get ordered both in frequencies and directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "These differences are also seen in the way the data from the wave reanalysis that will be explained below is obtained. These numerical models calculate different partitions that are present at the same time in a sea state, thus giving information about a windsea and different swells that can be reaching the shore at the same time. In our case (CSIRO wave reanalysis), one windsea will be always present if wind exists, and a total amount of three swells would be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To summarize, spectrums are the best possible option for the study of the wave climate in our days. They provide all the necessary information to define a sea state correctly and can be calculated by two different ways. First, based on the free measured surface and second, using the previously described equations and calculating the energy associated to each frequency and direction based on the sea states variables.**"
